This script is designed for the analysis of 16S amplicon data using a combination of cutadapt, Dada2, and knitr. The script is tailored for processing raw sequencing data, denoising, and generating a comprehensive analysis report. The workflow includes:

    cutadapt:
        Trims adapter sequences and filters low-quality reads from raw sequencing data.

    Dada2:
        Performs denoising, dereplication, and generates a table of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) to represent the microbial community.

    knitr:
        Integrates R code and text in a dynamic report, facilitating reproducibility and providing a detailed overview of the analysis process.

How to Run:

    Ensure that cutadapt, Dada2, and knitr are installed on your system.
    Customize input parameters within the script (e.g., file paths, quality thresholds).
    Execute the script in a terminal using the command: bash script_name.sh

Requirements:

    cutadapt
    Dada2 (R package)
    knitr (R package)

Output:

    Processed data files
    ASV table
    Quality assessment plots
    Comprehensive analysis report

This script streamlines the 16S amplicon data analysis pipeline, providing a robust and reproducible workflow for researchers studying microbial communities.
